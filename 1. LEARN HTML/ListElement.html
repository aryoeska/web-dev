<h2>Instructions</h2>

<h3>Prepare the Dough:</h3>

<ol>
    <li>In a large bowl, mix the warm milk, melted butter, and sugar. The temperature of the milk should be warm but not hot (about 110째F/43째C).</li>
    
    <li>Sprinkle the yeast evenly over the warm mixture and let it sit for about 5 minutes until the yeast is frothy.</li>
    
    <li>Add 4 cups of flour to the yeast mixture and stir until just combined. Cover the bowl with a damp towel and set aside in a warm place to rise for 1 hour until doubled in size.</li>

    <li>After 1 hour, remove the towel and add an additional 1 cup of flour, baking powder, and salt. Stir well until fully incorporated.</li>

    <li>In a separate bowl, combine the brown sugar and cinnamon.</li>

    <li>Turn out the dough onto a lightly floured surface and roll into a large rectangle, about 1/4 inch thick.</li>

    <li>Place the sliced rounds, slightly apart, in a buttered baking dish. Cover with a damp towel and let them rise for another 30 minutes.</li>

    <li>Preheat your oven to 350째F (175째C).</li>

    <li>Once the rolls have risen, bake them for about 25-30 minutes until golden brown.</li>

    <li>While the rolls are baking, beat together cream cheese, butter, powdered sugar, vanilla extract, and a pinch of salt in a bowl until creamy.</li>

    <li>Remove rolls from oven and while still warm, spread generously with cream cheese frosting.</li>
